NimbuslyDB

Introduction

NimbuslyDB provides an easy-to-use access layer over HTML5's local database 
functionality. It is intended to eventually provide the following features:

* Easy database access layer for HTML5 local database storage
* Centralized logging and error handling for HTML5 local database storage
* Simplified database initialization and upgrading using migrations
* A simple Object/Relational layer for storing and retrieving javascript objects
* A facility for synchronizing with a remote database

My intent is to make it easy to write apps javascript apps that will run in both
mobile and web environments, online or offline, and make your personal app data 
available regardless of how or when you access the app, in as seamless a way 
as possible. Only then will the full benefits of cloud computing be realized.

Getting Started

You will need a browser that supports HTML5 Local storage. I've been using Chrome.
Chrome requires that the HTML5 code to be downloaded from a server, so I have
Apache configured to access my development directory. There are unit tests in the 
test directory, using QUnit.
